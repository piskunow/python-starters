Welcome to the advanced usage tutorial for Python Starters. In this guide, we'll explore some of the more sophisticated features and commands that Python Starters offers, helping you to leverage its full potential for your project development.

## üöß Resolving Merge Conflicts

When updating starters, you might encounter merge conflicts between your local changes and the new updates from the starter. Python Starters provides a straightforward way to handle these conflicts.

## üé® Customizing Starters

Python Starters allows for deep customization of starters. After adding a starter to your project, you can modify it to better fit your needs. Here are some tips for customizing your starters:

1. **Modify Configuration Files**: Starters come with configuration files that you can adjust to change various aspects of the starter.

2. **Add Custom Templates**: You can add your own templates within the starter's directory, making it easy to extend the starter's functionality.

3. **Override Default Settings**: If a starter comes with default settings or files you don't need, feel free to modify or remove them.

Remember, Python Starters respects these customizations and will keep them intact during updates, unless there's a direct conflict with new changes.
